# PeakNote - Sprint 1 Retrospective

**Date:** Mar 28, 2025
**Participants:** Tianfa, Jamie, Rongze, Simon, Yuheng, Tianxiang, Zining

## Sprint Overview
**Sprint Goal:** Establish project foundation, complete initial planning, and deliver early prototypes
**Sprint Velocity:** 11.15 story points
**Completion Rate:** 76% (13 of 17 tasks marked as Done)

## What Went Well ðŸŽ‰

### 1. Documentation & Planning
- Successfully created comprehensive personas and user stories that will guide future development
- Requirements elicitation was thorough and provided clear direction
- Risk analysis document completed ahead of schedule

### 2. Team Collaboration
- Team roles were clearly assigned and understood by all members
- Cross-functional collaboration was effective, especially between design and development
- Team meetings were productive and focused


### 3. Technical Achievements
- CI/CD pipeline implementation was smooth and is already improving development workflow
- First app release was successfully published despite being a tight deadline
- Wiki documentation is comprehensive and well-organized

### 4. Individual Contributions
- simonliuanu managed multiple tasks efficiently
- Helixons delivered the landing page with high quality
- Yokyeee1114 created detailed user stories that will be valuable throughout the project
- jamiezhanggg's personas were detailed and research-based

## What Could Be Improved ðŸ”§

### 1. Task Estimation
- Several tasks (especially documentation tasks) were underestimated in terms of effort

- The landing page development (#17) took longer than expected (1.5 points)
- Paper prototype creation is still in progress despite initial time estimates

### 2. Communication
- Some requirements discussions took longer than necessary due to unclear initial scope

- Daily stand-ups sometimes went over the 15-minute timeframe

- Some team members were working on tasks without updating their progress in the board

### 3. Technical Challenges

- GitHub Actions setup encountered some unexpected issues that delayed completion

- Some team members needed additional support with the development environment setup

- Initial architecture decisions took longer than planned


### 4. Process Issues
- Three high-priority tasks are still in progress at sprint end

- Task dependencies weren't clearly identified at sprint planning
- Some tasks lacked clear acceptance criteria


## Action Items for Improvement ðŸ“‹

1. **Improve Estimation Accuracy**
   - Review completed tasks and use actual time spent for future similar tasks
   - Break down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks

   - Add buffer time for tasks involving external dependencies or new technologies
   - **Owner:** Rongze
   - **Due:** Before Sprint 2 Planning


2. **Enhance Communication**
   - Implement a "blockers" channel in Teams for quick resolution of issues

   - Enforce the 15-minute timebox for daily stand-ups with a timekeeper
   - Update task status in the board at least once daily

   - **Owner:** Simon
   - **Due:** Immediate implementation

3. **Address Technical Debt**
   - Schedule dedicated time to improve CI/CD pipeline stability
   - Create a knowledge-sharing session for development environment setup
   - Document architecture decisions more thoroughly in the wiki
   - **Owner:** Tianfa
   - **Due:** End of Sprint 2


4. **Process Refinement**
   - Create a definition of "Done" for different task types

   - Identify task dependencies during sprint planning
   - Add acceptance criteria to all user stories
   - **Owner:** Jamie
   - **Due:** Before Sprint 2 Planning


## Key Learnings ðŸ’¡

1. **Technical Insights**

   - The chosen tech stack is appropriate for our project goals but requires some upskilling

   - Early infrastructure setup pays dividends in development efficiency
   - Documentation-as-code approach is working well for the team


2. **Team Dynamics**

   - The team works effectively when roles are clearly defined
   - Pair programming sessions were particularly effective for complex tasks
   - Team members have complementary skills that we can leverage better


3. **Process Observations**
   - Our current sprint length (2 weeks) seems appropriate for our workflow
   - We need more rigorous testing procedures before marking items as "Done"

   - Breaking down requirements into smaller tasks improves delivery predictability

## Sprint 2 Preparation


Based on our retrospective, for Sprint 2 we will:
1. Adjust story point estimates based on Sprint 1 actuals

2. Implement clearer acceptance criteria for all tasks
3. Schedule knowledge-sharing sessions for technical topics

4. Identify dependencies during sprint planning
5. Prioritize completion of carried-over tasks from Sprint 1


## Team Morale


Overall team satisfaction with Sprint 1: **4/5**

Team members are generally satisfied with the progress made in establishing project foundations. There's excitement about moving into more development-focused work in Sprint 2, and the team feels confident about addressing the identified areas for improvement.

## Kudos Corner


- Special recognition to Simon for managing multiple critical tasks simultaneously
- Thanks to Yuheng for the comprehensive user stories that will guide our entire project

- Appreciation to Tianfa for delivering a high-quality landing page despite timeline challenges
- Recognition to Jamie for creating detailed, research-backed personas that clearly articulate user needs
